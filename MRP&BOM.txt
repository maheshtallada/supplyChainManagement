Material Requirement planning
	Inputs: 
		Inventory status		-- How many items of each type we already have -- current supply situation
		Master production schedule		--	How many items need to be produced and by when
		Bill of material BOM		--	How many items and respective sub items are needed to produce one end product.
	Outputs:
		Planned Orders Report		--	1. What needs to be delivered in the near future
										2. payments from the suppliers
		Order Release Report		-- what orders need to be released. -- takes help of Lead time to release orders (when to have what so as to minimise inventory and optimise supply chain)
		Order change Report 		--	

BOM : is a record of all the components of an item,
	  the parent- component relation ship,    ---  we need to know what suub-assemblies are required to manufacture the end product.
	  usage quantities derived					-- we need to know the quantities required also
		from Engineering and product design.

		

	End items
	Intermediate (one item can transform into another item, the second stage of an element is called intermediate)
	sub -assemblies (comb of two or more items)
	purchase items  OR Raw materials(does not have componenets, it comes from suppliers -- no involment of transformation or assembling -- have one or more parents)
	
	Before calculating no. of items required, the inventory needs to be checked.
	
	""Product Structure tree""
	
	Lead Times -- along with the quantity, we need to know how much time each sub assembly/intermediate item takes time to produce end item.
